# Overview

I tried to explore and learn basic syntax in Java language.
Since Java was an object-oriented language, I tried to use a few classes in order to better understand how object-oriented programming can better function.

I made an expense tracker that a user can ender an expense event with a date, description, and the amount spent for the event. 
This program will also be able to show the history of expense events, and end the program. 

The purpose of this will eventually help people to use their money more wisely. I struggle with this and I thought it would be nicer to record and see all the expense history.

# Development Environment

I develop this program in IntelliJ which helps to develop programming languages such as Java and Kotlin.

I used Java ArrayList, scanner, and file input and output libraries.

# Future Work

- I will add the feature to edit the history of expenses. 
- I will edit the program, so it will only take expense history in certain form.
