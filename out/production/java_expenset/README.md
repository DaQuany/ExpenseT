# Overview

I tried to explore and learn basic syntax in Java language.
Since Java was an object-oriented language, I tried to use a few classes in order to better understand how object-oriented programming can better function.

I made an expense tracker that a user can ender an expense event with a date, description, and the amount spent for the event. 
This program will also be able to show the history of expense events, and end the program. 

The purpose of this will eventually help people to use their money more wisely. I struggle with this and I thought it would be nicer to record and see all the expense history.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
